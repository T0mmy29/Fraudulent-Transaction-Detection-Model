#DESCRIPTION


I have developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the details of a bank customer.


This code is written in JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.


You must have jupyter notebook if you want to access the code and run it.


Forward to the link for the Data Set on which I've trained the Model.
